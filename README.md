# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave a company or stop using its services. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, this project helps organizations take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., discontinue their relationship with a company). The solution uses historical customer data, including demographic and behavioral features, to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, etc.
- Visualization of results and feature importances
- End-to-end pipeline for prediction

## Dataset

The project works with a customer churn dataset containing features such as:

- CustomerID
- Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account information (tenure, services subscribed)
- Usage statistics
- Payment and contract details
- Churn label (target variable)

> **Note:** The dataset can be replaced with your own or an open-source churn dataset.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swamniathan-04/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**  
   Place your data file (e.g., `churn_data.csv`) in the project directory.

2. **Run the main script:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View the results:**  
   Model outputs, evaluation metrics, and visualizations will be saved to the appropriate output folders.

## Modeling Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships
- Feature selection using statistical and model-based methods
- Training and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using test set and cross-validation

## Results

- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Feature importance analysis
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations
