****Summary:****

This project predicts customer churn for a video streaming service using machine learning. Identifying at-risk users helps the company take proactive steps to improve retention and reduce churn.

****Solution:****

 We trained multiple ML models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and SVM, to predict churn. The best model was selected based on the ROC AUC score, enabling the company to target users likely to cancel their subscriptions.  


****Approach:****

1. Predictions & Business Impact: Used the best model to predict churn, allowing targeted interventions.

2. Model Training & Evaluation: Trained multiple models and selected the best based on ROC AUC.

3. Data Sampling & Preprocessing: Selected 1000 samples, encoded categorical variables, and engineered features.
